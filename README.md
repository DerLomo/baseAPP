## Description

TND is a cutting-edge Android application designed to revolutionize the way we think about payments in the real world. Utilizing Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, TND bridges the gap between digital currency and everyday transactions. It serves a dual purpose: acting as both a payment app for consumers and a payment terminal for businesses. This innovative solution is designed with universality in mind, ensuring that anyone, anywhere, can transact using their favorite currency.

TND aims to eliminate these barriers, offering a seamless, secure, and efficient payment method. Our goal is to empower users and businesses alike, making digital currency payments as easy and accessible as traditional fiat currency transactions.

## Getting Started
